# PracticalActivityFibonacci
- This repository contains three C language programs: monolithic, iterative and recursive, each calculating the Fibonacci sequence. I used the Trace Machine method to identify strong equivalence between the programs. The source code and presentation used in the classroom are available here.

## Instruction
- Present simple programs (with the same function) of each type: Monolithic, Iterative and Recursive;
- Apply the Trace Machine (MT) method in order to identify strong equivalence between the implemented programs. Based on the chain generated by MT, present an example of equivalence and another of non-equivalence;
- The team have the choice to choose any programming languages, as well as their functionality (what they do). For monolithic programs, the C language is recommended (use of the goto command);
- The finished work must be presented in the classroom, with the following requirements met: Description and Execution of the Program, presentation of examples of computed functions involving the implemented programs;
